# **Richie Rich, CEO, CTO, COU**

### \* Center of Universe

---

Hey, I'm **Richie Rich**, start up extrodinaire.

I'm **Rich** with ideas and experience--to date, I've been the CEO, CTO, and COU of five different start ups. Which ones? It's not important.

### **What is important is that I have a million dollar app idea that will shake the market.**

If you're a **visionary** willing to work for **exposure** (and possibly a small percentage of non-existant equity), **touch base** with me.

I might offer you a position on our **dream team**. We're two dudes that are making no profit but we have **amazing synergy** and a Keurig Coffee machine. **(Remote positions only.)**

We currently have a no-payment internship open. Required experience in C++, C#, .NET, Java, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, MongoDB, Postgre SQL, Scala, Sequelize, Mongoose, Docker, Puppet, Jenkins, Apachi NiFi, AWS, TensorFlow, Django, Python, Rust, Scala, Ruby, Rails, Pascal, FORTRAN, and 20 years of experience in Golang.

40 hours a week; remote.

Richie Rich is a fake character who is absolutely not based off anyone I've worked with.

Definitely not.
